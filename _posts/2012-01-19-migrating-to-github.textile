There's probably thousands of ways to do this out there, but here's mine. A quick little shell script I wrote up to migrate a repository from a local gem-server up to github, including your branches and tags. All you need to do is create an empty repository on Github first.

For extra credit you could wire up to the "Github Repository API":http://develop.github.com/p/repo.html to create it for you.
