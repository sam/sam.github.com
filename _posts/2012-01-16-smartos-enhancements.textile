Here's a list of things, in no particular order, I'd like to see in SmartOS:

* FIX: Create zones/swap during configuration
* FIX: Create raidz vdevs during configuration (pending pull request: https://github.com/joyent/smartos-overlay/pull/4)
* ENHANCEMENT: Provide ability to specify dump device
* ENHANCEMENT: Provide ability to define "aggr" (LACP) interface during configuration
* FIX (low priority): Patch vmadmd/sysinfo to allow multiple zpools
* DOCUMENTATION: /opt/custom examples and use-cases

That's about it off the top of my head. Most of these things have work-arounds. I wouldn't consider any of them blocking issues, but they're the things I most frequently run into. If I find the time I'd like to contribute back. Most of these appear to just require a little scripting knowledge, and maybe a bit of node.js.
