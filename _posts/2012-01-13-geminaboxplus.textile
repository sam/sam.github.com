I just released a quick project to help you get quickly started running your own local Gem server. It's faster than going out to
Gemcutter all the time when you're bundling a project and you can keep private gems private. The Gemcutter project itself
assumes Amazon S3 integration, so "Geminabox":https://github.com/cwninja/geminabox is really a better fit for most local
installations I think.

"GeminaboxPlus":https://github.com/sam/geminaboxplus is just a default app for Geminabox with a patch to move reindexing
offline to a "Resque":https://github.com/defunkt/resque worker.

With this you can have a solid setup going in just a few minutes. If you want to increase your project's Bundler performance,
or could use a private Gem server, there's really no excuse not to just clone and fire up your own. :-)

The README has the full details, but if you want the 2-minute-and-running version I've copy/pasted the meat here:
