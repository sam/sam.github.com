I drove a 2009 Volvo C70 Convertible. I've owned and loved several Volvos. The dealership always treated us right. No complaints. Enter Jack.

This little guy needed something more family friendly. My wife has a Volvo XC90, which is truly a great family hauler, but it's a lease and we were burning through the miles far too quickly. My next car needed to be a purchase so we didn't have to worry about lease exits and someday maybe even pay it off. ;-)

This commercial got me into the Jeep dealer. No kidding, it's the best commercial I've ever seen. After the test-drive I was hooked.

h3. October 15th, 2010

A couple weeks later my wife, Jack and I were able to make it down to <a title="Dealership Website" href="http://www.dodgecityofmckinney.net/">Dodge City Dodge</a>. I spotted a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo X.

<img alt="Jeep at the dealer lot" src="/static/images/fail-rated-jeep/at-the-lot.jpg">
  
It had a V8. Everything I wanted but a sun-roof really. It was kitted out with all the off-roading features. I've never been off-roading before, but the idea of camping with the family, maybe hitting some light trails was exciting. If I was going to give up the Convertible, I was going camping damnit.

We were comparing against a Volvo XC60 we had already worked out the numbers on with the Volvo dealer. After tacking on the extended warranty to get rental coverage (which we'd always got from Volvo for free), the Jeep came in a few (within $10) bucks cheaper. We signed the paperwork that evening and went home with our new Jeep.

  <p>So now I was the proud owner of a <b>2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo X</b>. It had:
    <ul>
      <li>Hemi V8</li>
      <li>Leather</li>
      <li>Quadra Lift Air-Suspension</li>
      <li>Quadra Drive II traction-control system</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>October 16th, 2010</h4>

  <p>Camping! The closest OHV (<i>Off-Highway-Vehicle</i>) park I could find was <a title="Barnwell Mountain
    Recreation Area" href="http://www.barnwellmountainra.com/">Barnwell Mountain</a>. 2-1/2 hours away. My buddy
    Scott and I loaded up our sons, and hit the road. We got there just after dark. The next morning we drove
    around on the access roads a bit, looking for the easiest trail we could find.</p>
  <p>At a camp-site just at the mouth of a trail we bumped into a couple friendly guys in an older Land Rover
    Range Rover, lifted and with some big tires on it. Some of the body panels had seen better days. Clearly the
    truck had seen some fun. You can just spot it (and one of them standing in front of the Jeep, spotting the
    trail for us to lead us through) in this picture:</p>

  <div><img alt="Jeep hit the apex" src="/static/images/fail-rated-jeep/jeep-hit-the-apex.jpg"></div>

  <p>We caught the off-roading bug immediately. Three-wheelin', crossing creaky old bridges, the dusty red dirt
    that turned to paint if you ran across a puddle. It was a blast!</p>
  
  <div><img alt="Jeep approaching a rut" src="/static/images/fail-rated-jeep/jeep-approach.jpg"></div>
  
  <p>Scott traded in his Chevy Silverado and went out and bought a Toyota FJ Cruiser Trail Teams Edition about a
    month later.</p>
  
  
  <h4>October 23rd, 2010</h4>

  <p>The very next weekend, right after Jack's swim-class, my wife, Jack and I went out again. It was awesome. A bit
    brisk Sunday morning, but a bit of coffee to warm us up did the trick.</p>
  
  <div><img alt="Camp Smoot" src="/static/images/fail-rated-jeep/camp-smoot.jpg"></div>

  <p>We went out on the same trails, took 'em a bit better this time. My wife decided she didn't care for the
    off-roading bit. Three wheels on the ground and leans on rutted trails just weren't her cup o' tea. Still, the
    camping was great.</p>
  <p>Sunday evening a thunderstorm rolled in. Things got a bit sloshy getting out, and the under-carriage was
    liberally painted with the red dust, but we made it out before the worst of it hit. We stopped by Bodacious
    BBQ on the way out:</p>

  <p>Best Ribs I've had. Seriously. If you're even in East Texas do yourself a favor and stop here!</p>
  
  <h4>November 6th, 2010</h4>
  
  <p>My wife's sister joined us and the four of us headed out to Barnwell again for camping. Hit a few more trails
    with my sister-in-law. Found some more scenic ones this time. Some nice rides. Came up to a rock shelf we
    couldn't get past. The Grand Cherokee's wheel-base was just too long for it to avoid getting high-centered on
    it. Pretty sure about the only thing that could get past that is a Wrangler. Turning around in the dark is a
    bit scary. Thankfully there's spots for just that all over the trails, especially right before challenges like
    that.</p>
  <p>The tent was a bit chilly that evening, but camp-eggs and bacon in the morning made it all right. Jack loves
    camping since it's one of the few times we can let him run a bit free in a big area without worrying about
    cars or him getting into danger.</p>
  <p>Sunday my wife decided to give off-roading another shot and we hit the trails.</p>
  <p>We drove around on one of the more scenic trails and everyone had a good time. Hit the access roads in the
    park and decided to strike out in some new territory. Most of the two-diamond trails are pretty easy going for
    the big Jeep, so when we came across one named <i>"The Angry Jeep"</i>, we turned in, ready to tackle
    it.</p>
  <p>You enter the trail in some little trees, and then just beyond a clearing is a good sized hill. My wife took
    one look and said "take me back to camp". Well, the least I was going to do at that point was get a good
    picture. I put the transmission in Park and took my foot off the brake. The Jeep started rolling back slowly
    (we were on a bit of an incline at the foot of the hill). Odd, but if I'd ever lived in San Francisco I guess
    I would've known that that's normal. I put the parking brake on and hopped out to snap off a couple pictures.
    </p>
  <div><img alt="Jeep at the mouth of the Hill of Doom!" src="/static/images/fail-rated-jeep/hill-of-doom.jpg"></div>
  <p>Since we had just entered the trail, there was a spot to turnaround just about 20' back. When I hopped back
    in, I put the Jeep in Reverse and started backing up. It was a little sluggish, and needed more gas than
    seemed normal, but it was moving so I didn't think much of it.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that the traction-control knob is set to <b>Rock Crawling</b>, and the transfer-case is in
    <b>4-Low</b>. When I say "moving", I mean just barely. <b>2MPH</b> maybe. Out on the access roads I didn't
    generally break 5MPH since with all the stones laying about the suspension would hit the bump-stops (it was set to
    it's tallest "Off-road 2" height) pretty easily. No rush though.</p>
  <p>A little more gas, we'd probably moved about 10' so far&hellip;</p>
  <div style="font-size:12em; color: #a22; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PING!</div>
  <p>It sounded like a small rock just ricochetted against a skid-plate or something. I hadn't heard anything
    close out on the trails yet, but I'm new at this so. I hop out and look under the vehicle. About a foot of
    clearance with the air-suspension lifting it, so I'm able to get a good look around. No dents. No pings. The
    skid plates look fine, no way anything touched. Well, that's a bit of a relief.</p>
  <p>Shortly after we get back to camp we pack up and head on out. When we get back to the drive up to the park,
    and hit asphalt again I turn off 4-Low and put the traction-control back on <i>Auto</i>. The drive-train
    starts slipping something awful. If I turn the traction-control knob to <i>Snow/Mud</i> it gets moving again.
    So issue with the traction-control system I think. I'm convinced something to do with forgetting the parking
    brake. Either way, it's a Sunday, not dealers are open and we're 100 miles from home. I hit the road and keep
    it at 55MPH just in case. Under hard acceleration there's a knocking sound. Loose brake pads? I don't know. We
    make it home without further issue though.</p>
    
  <h4>November 8th, 2010</h4>
    
  <p>I take the Jeep into the shop. I explain I forgot about the parking brake when the trouble started so I'm
    keeping my fingers crossed that it's covered. In hind-sight who hasn't driven a car for a block or two and
    forgot about the parking brake? Of course it's covered.</p>
  <p>I also asked them to fit the missing pins for the front air-dam. It's held on by large thumb screws. <i>The
    vehicle was missing a couple from the factory</i>. The problem is they also hold up the felt-like sound
    insulation in the wheel wells and since the one on the driver's side was soaked through and weighed down with
    the clay like mud the tire rubbed through it and chewed it up.</p>
  <p>I'm out <b>$237.19</b>.</p>
  <p>I'm a bit annoyed about that one since it's not like I lost those pins. They were definitely MIA when I
    examined the air-dam during removal. The air-dam is made to be removed for extra <i>approach</i>, so I wanted
    to figure out how. It's not as easy as it sounds since there are some snap-in clips to pop out as well. It's
    definitely not something you'll be messing with on a routine basis.</p>
  <p>Anyways, my service guy Stephen calls me back the next day and says the axle is snapped.</p>
  <p>You read that right, that loud ping wasn't a rock. It was the driver's side rear half-shaft snapping! :o</p>
  <p>The dealer says it clear wasn't the parking brake and the repairs are covered. The theory of the engineers
    they talked to is the wheel got spinning, free-wheelin', touched down, caught a rock edge or something that
    stopped it instantly, and the sudden jarring snapped it.</p>
  <p>Take a look at the picture again, I'll wait. See how all four wheels are on the ground? Remember how I said I
    had the vehicle in 4-Low with the most aggressive traction-control setting (rock-crawling) on? Obviously the
    engineers aren't considering all the facts. It shouldn't even be possible with those settings to reproduce
    their theory.</p>
  <p>Back to the repairs then. I'm waiting around about a week for the axle to be replaced, and then I get a call.
    </p>
  <p>They've removed the axle to replace it and discovered that the air-bag (for the air-suspension) and brakes
    also need to be replaced. On top of that the end of the axle in the rear-differential is fused to the
    differential housing so the Jeep needs a new differential.</p>
    
div. <img alt="Incompetent Mechanic" src="/static/images/fail-rated-jeep/incompetent-mechanic.jpg">

  <p>Seriously? You see that there's a snapped axle and it never occurs to you to pull it out and check to see if
    there's any further damage?!? You've got to be kidding me.</p>
  <p>Fine. So the part is on order. New vehicle, none have had this issue, the part isn't in the supply-line yet.
    No ETA.</p>
  <p>So I'll keep driving around the rental Chevy Cobalt until I hear back. Next thing I know Enterprise
    Rent-a-Car is calling me saying I owe them $200 or something. Remember when I said we bought the extended
    warranty for the rental coverage? So I call back the dealer and ask what the deal is. They can't locate my
    warranty. Ok. The vehicle is only a few weeks old by this point. I'll give them the benefit of a doubt. I tell
    him to walk across the shop floor to the sales office, and talk to the finance guy who sold us the coverage.
    Stephen says he'll handle it.</p>
  <p>A couple days later Enterprise calls back saying they're about to bill my card on file.</p>
  <div style="font-size:12em; color: #d22; text-align: center;">WTF?!?</div>
  <p>So I call Stephen back. He never talked to the finance guy. Fine, I'll sort it out myself. I call the finance
    guy, Julian. He says I'm covered, he'll talk to Stephen. I call Enterprise up later that day and they say no
    one from Dodge City Dodge has called. This is getting old. I talk to Julian again, he follows up with
    Enterprise, and it's settled. After talking to Stephen again I learn that the coverage is only for 5 days in a
    rental.</p>
    
  <p>Shame on me for not reading the fine print I guess? Forget that:</p>
  
  <blockquote style="color: #22c;">I want rentals covered.</blockquote>
  <blockquote style="color: #c22;">Buy this extended warranty and they will be.</blockquote>
  <blockquote style="color: #22c;">We were told the same thing by Mazda a few years ago on our Mazda 6 only to
    find out that it required it to be in the shop for diagnosis before we'd get a rental, and that could take
    more than a day. I don't want any gotchas, I just want the loaner.</blockquote>
  <blockquote style="color: #c22;">Don't worry about it. Full coverage. You bring your Jeep in, you get a
    loaner.</blockquote>

  <p>5 days of coverage? Unacceptable. Stephen talked to his manager, who talked to Chrysler I understand, and
    they got it covered.</p>
  <p>Just after Thanksgiving I'm swapped into a Chrysler Town & Country minivan for my rental. Not in time to
    keep us from having to put more miles on my wife's vehicle over the holiday, but still a lot better than a
    Cobalt.</p>
  
    
h3. December 8th, 2010

  <p>The Jeep is ready, I can pick it up. 30 days in the shop. Pretty crazy, but it did sound like a lot of work
    and they did eventually get the part in after pulling some strings so I appreciated the effort the dealer went
    through to get the thing put back together despite the hiccups with the mechanics. I pay the $237.19 to get
    that insulation replaced in the wheel well and the air-dam clips.</p>
  <p>I get the Jeep back and I'm in love with it as ever. Still singing it's praises to anyone who'll listen.
    First thing I do is take it to get it detailed since I had to put it in the shop with the spatter and trail
    dust all over it.</p>
  
h3. December 9th, 2010

  <p>It's been a long week at work, with a couple very late nights. I'm ready for the weekend and some camping. On
    the way back to the office after stepping out for dinner and coffee I decide I'd better test the 4WD system
    since I didn't get a chance to the evening I picked it up. In the Starbucks parking lot I put the transmission
    into neutral, turn the traction-control knob to rock-crawling, and hit the 4-Low button. Everything engages
    smoothly. I feather on the gas and in just a couple feet a red light comes on on the traction-control panel,
    my dash is displaying "4WD SRV", "Service 4WD System" and "Service Air Suspension" lights.</p>
  <p>Damnit.</p>
  <div><img alt="10MPH" src="/static/images/fail-rated-jeep/10-miles.jpg"></div>
  <p>I push the 4-Low button again and turn the traction-control dial back to <i>Auto</i> to disable everything.
    No joy. It's stuck in 4-Low. Ok, now I'm pissed. The vehicle was "fixed" and the mechanic never thought to
    confirm it actually worked?</p>
  <p>So I work near the "High Five" in Dallas. That's a 30 mile or so ride home. The manual tells me to keep it
    under 25MPH in 4-Low. When I'm done at work for the evening I drive home at 20MPH up Coit Rd with my hazard
    lights on the whole way. I get home around 3AM.</p>
  
h3. December 11th, 2010

Less than 48 hours after picking it up, the Jeep is back in the shop and I'm back in a rental. This time the rental is a Chevy Silverado. So that's better. Not to knock on the Cobalt, it's a much nicer little car than I expected, but I'm not paying Jeep Grand Cherokee money to drive around a Cobalt.

  <p>Or a Silverado for that matter, but you can't win 'em all I guess.</p>
  <img style="float: right;" alt="Nissan Xterra" src="/static/images/fail-rated-jeep/xterra.jpg">
  <p>A week later or so Enterprise calls me saying they need the Silverado because they've sold it. A bit odd, but
    OK. I drop it off and exchange it for a Nissan Xterra. The Xterra is a lot more powerful than I expected.
    Probably about the same acceleration as the Grand Cherokee I'd guess. It's towing capacity is much lower but
    still, it's got me questioning if I actually need a vehicle that costs twice as much if I just want a nice
    family hauler and camper.</p>
  <p>I'm pissed this time. I get my sales-guy involved, as well as the service manager. The Service Manager
    (Scott) acts like they did me a favor fixing it the first time since I was clearly "muddin' it". Let's get a
    couple things straight:

* I wasn't "muddin' it"
* If I had, I would've been stuck. The stock "off-road" tires aren't even AT tires, much less MT tires

  <p>I call up Chrysler Customer Care. I emphasize that they need to call my number. The following week they call
    my wife's. She tells them to call me as she's walking into a meeting, they say OK and we never hear back
    again.</p>
  <p>I call them again a few days later. I expect to have the same rental coverage issues. They promise a call
    from someone in that department before the end of the day, as well as the follow up I never actually got
    within 48 hours. I never get the call about the rental but the dealership got it sorted this time anyway.</p>

Friends suggest I open up a Twitter account and post to "@Chrysler":http://twitter.com/Chrysler. So I do. I'm asked if Chrysler Customer Care has contacted me. Nope. Later that day I get a call from CCC. I explain the original issue and the guy tells me it's abuse since the parking brake was on.

  <p>The CCC rep is seriously trying to tell me I shouldn't be surprised when this Trail Rated Jeep snaps an axle,
    because the parking brake was left on for a few feet.</p>
  <p>Obviously he's a jack-ass. He says he'll talk to the dealer. I never hear back.</p>
  <p>A few more days pass, and the Jeep is ready again. I drive by the dealer to pick it up the following day.</p>
  
  <h4>December 21st</h4>
  
  <p>Picked up the Jeep, and it seems to be working this time. Apparently the clutch on the transfer-case had
    burned out.</p>
  <p>I talk to Scott, the Service Manager. He admits they checked out the tow-hooks and there's no evidence the
    vehicle was towed out of a mud trap, I obviously wasn't muddin'. He says even though I kept it under the
    recommended speed for 4-Low the drive home from work could've contributed to the transfer case failure. Please
    call customer assistance and get a tow next time.</p>
  <p>Fair enough.</p>
  <p>I wonder about Sundays or when it's 3AM though? I need to ask 'em&hellip;</p>
  <p>Anyway, the tone of this conversation is different. He brings up the theory on why the axle snapped again,
    and I explain to him the traction-control setting and 4-Low. At this point it seems the only plausible
    explanation I've heard is that the axle was simply weak/defective from the factory.</p>
  <p>So I take the Jeep home.</p>
  <p>A day or two later I try out the air-suspension on my way out of the office. I hit the <i>UP</i> button a couple
    times to raise it to it's highest setting, <i>Off-road 2</i>. On the way past the <i>Off-road 1</i> height a
    warning pops up on the dash saying the system needs to cool off.</p>
  <p>That's odd. Never seen it before and I hadn't exercised the system at all. I might understand if it was
    really hot outside, or if I'd been using it continuously, but I'd just got in the Jeep and it was in the low
    40's outside. Coldest weather since I'd bought it.</p>
  <p>Still, maybe just a fluke. Nothing too alarming so I resolve to take it into the shop after the holiday and
    head home.</p>

Over the weekend I try it a few more times. I get the message maybe once more, but mostly it just seems to be degrading overall.

h3. December 27th, 2010


By Monday morning when I take it into the shop it has trouble reaching Normal Ride Height (after sitting overnight at Loading Height) and won't go into either of the taller off-road settings. The light on the button just blinks continuously, the dash indicator showing the car raising doesn't come on and there's no movement.

Also the driver's seat warmer keeps turning itself off after a few seconds.

At the dealer the mechanic comes out and checks it out with me. He explains that the seat warmer shuts off after awhile automatically to avoid overheating. Seat warmers can get uncomfortably warm if you leave them on. This definitely wasn't overheating. It was simply faulting.

He told me about the warning I'd mentioned on the air-suspension, and while it did make it to Normal Ride Height while at the dealership, it didn't make it to either of the off-road heights and even the NRH setting took minutes where normally it takes seconds. Something clearly wasn't right.

So Enterprise was called to pick me up.

I'm out at Enterprise and the Dodge dealership calls saying send me on back, the car is ready. That's weird but whatever. OK. So Enterprise drops me back off at the dealership.

The mechanic sits in the Jeep with me while I test it. _Off-road 1_: Success. Kinda. It takes a minute. Something's definitely not right. _Off-road 2_: Nothing. I made sure to film it on my phone.

<blockquote style="color: #c22;">I'm sorry, I thought you were worried about the Off-road 1 setting.</blockquote>

Seriously? Is this also the guy that didn't take the broken axle off for a week? I want the damn car to work like new. It's two months old at this point and has been in the shop for 41 days! Obviously nobody would buy the Quadra Lift system if it was going to be considered normal for it to degrade to the point it took minutes to work and half the heights were unavailable just a couple months off the dealer lot.

h3. December 28th, 2010

So there we are. I just got a call back from Stephen to pick it up. Day 75 of ownership. 44 days in the shop so far.

h3. Epilogue

So what do I want from Chrysler at this point?

Well, after the first 30 days I would've hoped they'd perform something like the re-certification that used cars get. After the second time at least. I had to ask the dealership a number of times to check the transmission fluid to make sure it wasn't toast and the next thing to go (they did, and it looked fine to my untrained eyes, not visibly scorched or anything).

I've got a vague explanation about Chrysler's specs on the air-suspension settings being wrong and working with the service department at Dodge City Dodge to sort it all out. I guess something to do with the "fill" of the system since one of the air-bags was replaced earlier in the whole ordeal. I'd put money down that nobody's even looked at the seat-warmer.

At this point though, that's someone else's problem.

h3. December 29th, 2010

After picking my Jeep up this morning it appears the dealer didn't identify the problem. So instead of simply admitting that and asking me to keep an eye out for it, they pretended like it didn't exist. As if they hadn't seen the issue with the Air Suspension with their own eyes just a couple days before.

The pickup paperwork, which in hindsight I probably shouldn't have acknowledged with a signature, says that "I was using it too much" and causing it to overheat. Which is complete BS. Turning the car on from a cold start, and trying to get it into <i>Off-road 2</i> height is not using it too much.

Chrysler really needs to do something about making sure people get calls back and that the dealership isn't trying to sweep genuine issues under the rug. Especially when the customer has it on video. Maybe I'll post it to Youtube, but I'm a bit busy right now, and all I really care about is getting some results. I'm not interested in bad-mouthing Chrysler for the sake of it. There's no such thing as a manufacturer that never makes a mistake when they're putting millions of cars on the road. I just got unlucky with one vehicle that happened to ship with a bad axle. It had to happen to someone I guess. It's how you respond to such mistakes that matters though.

This morning the dealer is right though, the system appears to work flawlessy. It responds instantly, and doesn't overheat even after a couple full up/down cycles. Which is what I expect. Might I get it to overheat trying to push it further? Maybe, I don't know. I'm not expecting miracles though, getting a couple cycles out of it is what I had before, it's what I expect it to do, I'm fine with that.

That said, the outside temperature readout on the dash from the previous video says 37&deg;. This morning it was 63&deg;. What do you want to bet that when it dips into the low 30's again this weekend the issue comes right back? Perhaps when the airbag was replaced they just used the air-compressor on the shop-floor, introducing moisture, causing excess strain to the system at lower temperatures? It's just a theory, but it seems plausible, and is more than I got from the dealer who decided to simply pretend the issue several people there saw with their own eyes simply didn't exist a couple days later.
