Just a quick note. You might sometimes find yourself wanting to filter a list of files on your system. We'll use a clone of this blog for an example. You could use @grep@:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1642129.js?file=gistfile1.sh"></script>

Regexps are obviously very powerful, and I often use something similar in my own scripts.

For simple cases like this however, you might want to get familiar with the built-in Bash wildcards:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1642114.js?file=gistfile1.sh"></script>

Quick and easy. Hope you find it useful.
